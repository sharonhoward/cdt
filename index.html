<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Between July 1789 and October 1792 the keeper of Newgate gaol, Richard Akerman, submitted to the Justices of the Peace at the Middlesex Sessions of the Peace a series of lists of convicts sentenced to transportation whom he had conveyed from Newgate to various vessels along the Thames or south coast ports, along with his detailed accounts of the substantial expenses incurred in the process. After the JPs approved his claims and made orders for payment, the names of the convicts and (in most cases) their destinations were neatly copied into the Sessions Order Books. After October 1792 the expenses continued to be periodically recorded in the Order Books, but not the convicts' names. </p>

<h2>
<a id="coverage-and-context" class="anchor" href="#coverage-and-context" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coverage and Context</h2>

<p>Akerman's lists named a total of 1515 offenders convicted at the Old Bailey and Middlesex Sessions (the lists do not contain details of individuals' trials) whom he conveyed from Newgate and delivered to a number of destinations between January 1785 and July 1792. Not all of the 1515 actually embarked for Australia, but it is likely that the vast majority did so. Thus, the lists chronicle the very beginnings of the enforced emigration of, ultimately, more than 160,000 offenders from Britain to Australia between 1787 and 1868, and they document a stage of the convicts' long journey for which there are few surviving records earlier than the 19th-century prison hulk registers held at The National Archives (primarily TNA HO8-9, ADM6). </p>

<p>They also complement the earliest Home Office Criminal Registers (TNA HO26) which have also been digitised by <a href="http://www.londonlives.org/static/CR.jsp">London Lives</a>. The next stage of the voyage is covered by the <a href="http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/family-history/convicts">Convict Transportation Registers</a>, indexed by the State Library of Queensland; and by the earliest convict indents, which have been digitised and indexed by the <a href="https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/indexes-online/indexes-to-convict-records/index-to-early-convict-records">New South Wales State Archives</a>. </p>

<p>Record linkage will be carried out on the dataset by the <a href="http://www.digitalpanopticon.org">Digital Panopticon project</a>, in order to link as many of the names as possible to these related records and to the <a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org">Old Bailey Proceedings</a>. The resulting linked data will also be made freely available at a later stage.  </p>

<a id="the-data" class="anchor" href="#the-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Data</h2>

<p>The data file <strong>LondonLives_delivered_convicts_201511.csv</strong> contains the name, aliases and gender of each prisoner; the delivered date and, where named, the contractor, ship or hulk, and location; the date of the court session at which the list was presented; and the necessary identifiers to link the data back to London Lives. </p>

<p>Some transcription and tagging errors have been corrected, but it is likely that less obvious ones remain. London Lives URLs have been included in the data to facilitate checking against the images of the original pages; . </p>
