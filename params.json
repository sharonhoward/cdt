{"name":"LondonLives: Middlesex Convicts ","tagline":"Convicts For Transportation, 1785-1792","body":"Middlesex Convicts Delivered For Transportation, 1785-1792\r\n====================\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nBetween July 1789 and October 1792 the keeper of Newgate gaol, Richard Akerman, submitted to the Justices of the Peace at the Middlesex Sessions of the Peace a series of lists of convicts sentenced to transportation whom he had conveyed from Newgate to various vessels along the Thames or south coast ports, along with his detailed accounts of the substantial expenses incurred in the process. After the JPs approved his claims and made orders for payment, the names of the convicts and (in most cases) their destinations were neatly copied into the Sessions Order Books. After October 1792 the expenses continued to be periodically recorded in the Order Books, but not the convicts' names. \r\n\r\n\r\nCoverage and Context\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAkerman's lists named a total of 1515 offenders convicted at the Old Bailey and Middlesex Sessions (the lists do not contain details of individuals' trials) whom he conveyed from Newgate and delivered to a number of destinations between January 1785 and July 1792. Not all of the 1515 actually embarked for Australia, but it is likely that the vast majority did so. Thus, the lists chronicle the very beginnings of the enforced emigration of, ultimately, more than 160,000 offenders from Britain to Australia between 1787 and 1868, and they document a stage of the convicts' long journey for which there are few surviving records earlier than the 19th-century prison hulk registers held at The National Archives (primarily TNA HO8-9, ADM6). \r\n\r\nThey also complement the earliest Home Office Criminal Registers (TNA HO26) which have also been digitised by [London Lives](http://www.londonlives.org/static/CR.jsp). The next stage of the voyage is covered by the [Convict Transportation Registers](http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/resources/family-history/convicts), indexed by the State Library of Queensland; and by the earliest convict indents, which have been digitised and indexed by the [New South Wales State Archives](https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/indexes-online/indexes-to-convict-records/index-to-early-convict-records). \r\n\r\nRecord linkage will be carried out on the dataset by the [Digital Panopticon project](http://www.digitalpanopticon.org), in order to link as many of the names as possible to these related records and to the [Old Bailey Proceedings](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org). The resulting linked data will also be made freely available at a later stage.  \r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe dataset and this documentation are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\r\n\r\nThis means that you are free to copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format; and to remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially, providing you follow the terms of the licence:\r\n\r\n* You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. \r\n* If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. \r\n\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSuggested format for academic citation:\r\n\r\nSharon Howard, 'Middlesex Convicts Delivered for Transportation 1785-92', *London Lives, 1690-1800* (2015).\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe dataset has been created using the transcriptions of the Order Books published at the [London Lives website](www.londonlives.org).

I am grateful to Tim Hitchcock and Bob Shoemaker, the London Lives project directors, for agreeing to share this data.\r\n        \r\nThe original documents are held at the London Metropolitan Archives, part of the Middlesex Sessions Records series (MJ/OC/11-12).\r\n\r\nThe data was created while working on the [Digital Panopticon project](http://www.digitalpanopticon.org), funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Data\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe data file **LondonLives_delivered_convicts_201511.csv** contains the name, aliases and gender of each prisoner; the delivered date and, where named, the contractor, ship or hulk, and location; the date of the court session at which the list was presented; and the necessary identifiers to link the data back to London Lives. \r\n\r\nSome transcription and tagging errors have been corrected, but it is likely that less obvious ones remain. London Lives URLs have been included in the data to facilitate checking against the images of the original pages; . \r\n\r\n### cdt_id\r\n\r\nDataset unique identifier.\r\n \r\n### ll_id\r\n\r\nThe unique identifier for the prisoner in the London Lives database.  \r\n\r\n###  ll_img\r\n\r\nThe identifier for the image in which the prisoner appears.\r\n\r\n###  ll_url\r\n\r\nThe URL of the page in which the prisoner appears.\r\n\r\n###  session_date\r\n\r\nThe date (month and year) of the court session at which Akerman submitted the list containing the convict's name, as given in the order book. (This is completely unrelated to the date of the convict's trial, which is never given.)\r\n\r\n###  pris_number\r\n\r\nThe prisoner's number in the list.
